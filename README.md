# MeGa-VieW 2.15 - Textviewer with archive support for Amiex 3.18+ 

These are the sources of my Amiex Textviewer called "MeGa-VieW".

I've successfully compiled these sources with SAS/C 6.58 on my WinUAE system, to compile just enter:

```
sc *.c PARMS=REGISTER NOSTKCHK SCODE SDATA STRIPDBG NOMINC NOICONS LINK
```

Please note that this version was never published, as it was intended only for my registered users back in 1994....

Have fun,
